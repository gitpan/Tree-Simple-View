Revision history for Perl extension Tree-Simple-View.

0.06 Fri July 2 2004
    - Added a number of tests to the suite as well as 
      improved some existing tests.

0.05 Fri Jun 25 2004
    - changes the HREF part of the DHTML links to be
      javascript:void(0) rather than just #, it stops
      a problem in some browsers where clicking a link
      would scroll you to the top of the page.
      - updated tests to reflect this change
    - removed some code which was not nessecary from the
      Tree::Simple::View::HTML class.

    !*!*!*! MAJOR UPDATE !*!*!*!
    - My orginal vision for Tree::Simple::View was that of
      a Proxy/Factory/I-Dont-Know-What-I-Was-Thinking class.
      But the idea really wasn't that good, matter of fact
      it was pretty bad. So this version marks a major update
      to the module, the details of which are below.
      - Tree::Simple::View::Base has been removed, its code
        has been moved to Tree::Simple::View.
      - Tree::Simple::View is no longer a "Proxy" class (not
        that it ever really was) for the Tree::Simple::View::*
        classes. It now is the abstract base class, taking on
        the role that Tree::Simple::View::Base once served.
      - Tree::Simple::View::HTML has been updated to reflect 
        its new base class. (Tree::Simple::View::DHTML is a 
        subclass of Tree::Simple::View::HTML, so it didn't need
        to be changed). 
      - All documentation has been updated to reflect these changes.
    - I have added a bunch of tests while I was at it.

0.03 Wed Jun 23 2004
    - fixed a number of little issues with the DHTML class
        - fixed problems with combined CSS configurations
          and the expand-collapse functionality
        - fixed a bug whereby expandPath did not work
          properly
    - added an example file of the DHTML output 
      (examples/DHTML_example.html)
    - added some documentation here and there

0.02 Tues Jun 22 2004
    - added simple accessors for the tree and configurations
      to the Base class
    - added the 'form_element_formatter' to the DHTML class
      which allows for form elements to be added to the tree
      outside of the link tag. 
    - fixed a bug in the DHTML implementation where the DHTML
      would not work if you had not set a link_css value. Now
      you it does work :)

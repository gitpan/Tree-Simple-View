0.03 Wed Jun 23 2004
    - fixed a number of little issues with the DHTML class
        - fixed problems with combined CSS configurations
          and the expand-collapse functionality
        - fixed a bug whereby expandPath did not work
          properly
    - added an example file of the DHTML output 
      (examples/DHTML_example.html)
    - added some documentation here and there

0.02 Tues Jun 22 2004
    - added simple accessors for the tree and configurations
      to the Base class
    - added the 'form_element_formatter' to the DHTML class
      which allows for form elements to be added to the tree
      outside of the link tag. 
    - fixed a bug in the DHTML implementation where the DHTML
      would not work if you had not set a link_css value. Now
      you it does work :)
